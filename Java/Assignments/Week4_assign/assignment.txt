1) Reflect yourself as an 'OOP' entity and define your 'state' and 'behaviors'.
2) Find output of given code and draw the JVM digram
class Child {

	int a = 10;
	static int b = 20;
}

class Demo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Child c1 = new Child();
		Child c2 = new Child();

		c1.a = 40;
		c1.b = 40;

		System.out.println(c1.a + " " + c1.b);
		System.out.println(c2.a + " " + c2.b);
	}
}

3) Write a real time example of Class and Object on 'Vegetable Market'

4) Find out the difference bewteen System.out.print() and System.out.println()
by typing a code and write the difference as comment in code

5)Use System.out.printf()in your program to print int and char value.
